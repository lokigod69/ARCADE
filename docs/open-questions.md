# Open Questions

None for this stage. All previously noted items are resolved as follows:
- `Magic Mushrooms` stays excluded until authentic assets return.
- Dev Tools will enumerate any localStorage keys per origin, read-only, without additional standardisation.
- Tutorial overlays will start from a shared template populated from manifest controls; bespoke copy can ship later.
